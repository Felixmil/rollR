This R package provides a simple way to make all sorts of dice rolls using syntax inspired from tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons & Dragons.


## Installation

```
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("felixmil/rollr")
```


## Examples

``` r
library(rollr)

roll_dice("1d12") # rolls one 12-sided dice

roll_dice("1d20+2") # roll one 20-sided dice then adds 2

roll_dice("2d10 + 1d4") # rolls two 10-sided dice and one 4-sided diced and sums their results 

roll_dice("4d6h3") # rolls four 6-sided dice and sum the 3 highests

roll_dice("2d20l1") # rolls two 20-sided dice and keeps the lowest one

```


## Use Case

in Dungeon & Dragons 5th Edition, ability scores are set by rolling 4d6 (four 6-sided dice) and keeping the 3 highest ones (ability scores can range between 3 and 18). 

Let's say we want to create a new character: Dunrill, a strong and muscular Dwarf. We roll our first set of 4 6-sided dice and keep the 3 highests.

```{r}
library(rollr)

set.seed(42)

roll_results <- roll_dice("4d6h3", roll_history = TRUE) 
```

That's a 7. Now, the same roll (4d6h3) must be reproduced 5 more times:

```{r}
more_roll_results <- replicate(5, roll_dice("4d6h3"))

all_results <- c(roll_results, more_roll_results)

print(all_results)
```
Now, we can assign these 6 values to Dunrill abilities (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution...) move on with character creation.

But **were we lucky rolling these values: `r paste(all_results, collapse=", ")` ?**

To know that, we'll simulate 9999 4d6h3 rolls and approximate the probability distribution.
```{r,cache=TRUE}
random_rolls <- replicate(9999, roll_dice("4d6h3"))
```

Probability distribution for 4d6h3 looks like this:
```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(emojifont)

mode = tibble(r = random_rolls) %>%
  group_by(r) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(n == max(n)) %>% 
  pull(r)

mean = round(mean(all_results),2)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.asp=0.68, fig.align='center', fig.retina=TRUE}

plot <- random_rolls %>%
  tibble(r = .) %>%
  ggplot(data=., aes(x=r)) +
  geom_density(color="black",size=2,bw=1)+
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), 
                 position='identity',
                 binwidth = 1,
                 fill="#AF0000", 
                 color="white",
                 alpha=0.8)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = mode,
             color="white", linetype="dashed", size=2)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(3,18,1))+
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))+
  labs(title = "Probability distribution for 4d6h3 dice roll", 
       x= "roll result",
       y="probability density")+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(text = element_text(size=14),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=14,face = 'bold'))

plot +
  geom_label(data = tibble(x=1), x=15.5, y = 0.11, label = '50% chance to get\n a score above 13',size=4, hjust=0)+
  geom_label(data = tibble(x=1),x=9.5, y = 0.11, label = '50% chance to get\n a score below 13',size=4, hjust=1)
  
```


Distribution's mode is **`r mode`**, however, the mean of our rolls is **`r mean`**:


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.asp=0.68,fig.align='center',fig.retina=TRUE}
emojifont::load.emojifont()
plot +
  geom_text(data= tibble(x=1),label= ":(", x= mean, y = 0.05, size=6)+
  geom_segment(xend=1.05*mean, x=0.98*mode,y=0.05, yend=0.05,arrow = arrow(type = "closed"))+
  labs(title="Our luck was below average...")
```


## Rolls syntax (supported dice rolls)

Features list derivated from [Sidekick](https://github.com/ArtemGr/Sidekick)

- [x] `/r 1d8 + 2` - Roll one octahedron and add two.

- [x] `/r 1d8 + 4d6` - Roll one octahedron and four hexahedrons.

- [x] `/r 2d20h1` - Roll twice and keep the highest roll (D&D 5e advantage).

- [x] `/r 2d20h1 + 2` - Roll twice and keep the highest roll, with a modifier (D&D 5e advantage).

- [x] `/r 4d6h3` - Roll four hexahedrons and keep the highest three (D&D 5e ability roll).

- [x] `/r 2d20l1` - Roll twice and keep the lowest roll (D&D 5e disadvantage).

- [x] `/r 1d20r1` - Roll twenty, reroll on one (because halflings are lucky).

- [x] `/r 3d6!` - Exploding dice.

- [x] `/r 2d6>=5` - Roll two hexahedrons and take only the ones that turned greater or equal to five (aka difficulty check). Prints the number of successes.

- [x] `/r 4d6=5` - So can this guy roll five?

- [ ] `/r 3d10>=6f1` - oWoD roll: rolling *one* is a failure, rolling more failures than successes is a *botch*.

- [ ] `/r 1d10>=8f1f2` - Rolling *one* or *two* is a failure.

- [ ] `/r 4dF` - [Fudge/Fate dice](http://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/1765/what-game-circumstance-uses-fudge-dice).

- [ ] `/r 1d10!>9` - Explode nine and ten.

- [ ] `/r 3d10!>=8` - nWoD roll: tens explode, eights and up are treated like a success.

- [ ] `/r 1d10t10` - If a ten is rolled then count it twice.


- [ ] `/r repeat (4d6k3, 6)` - Roll D&D 5e ability score six times (to generate a new character).

- [ ] `/r repeat (d6, 3, brief)` - In Nomine. 1, 1, 1.

- [ ] `/r repeat (1d20+1, 5, short sum)` - Sum the rolls.

- [ ] `/r ova (5)` - OVA. 6, 6, 1, 1, 1 = 12.

## TO DO

- [ ] Support all rolls syntax above
- [ ] Add function to replicate a dice command n times (don't reparse dice command each time)
- [ ] Create Vignette (from Use case ?)
